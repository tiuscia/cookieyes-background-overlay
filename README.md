# cookieyes: how to add a background overlay
Want a background overlay for your CookieYes cookie banner (Basic plan)? 
Here is how to add a backhround overlay to CookieYes Banners.
This code snippet offers a solution since the Basic plan (paid) lacks this functionality. 
Add a visually distinct background to enhance your cookie consent message.


My scenario:
- SPA
- vue.js
- cookie yes with basic plan
- Button: accept + save preference


## Note
if you have a reject button you will need to add a query selector for that
