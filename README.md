# cookieyes: how to add a background overlay
Want a background overlay for your CookieYes cookie banner (Basic and free plan)? 
Here is how to add a background overlay to CookieYes Banners.
This code snippet offers a solution since the Basic and free plan lack this functionality. 
Add a visually distinct background to enhance your cookie consent message.

### Example:
<img width="1431" alt="Screenshot 2024-07-03 at 2 41 02 PM" src="https://github.com/tiuscia/cookieyes-background-overlay/assets/9962761/7802af51-f5b1-41ed-8f48-279e7a39c842">


### My scenario
- SPA (Single Page Application)
- Vue.js
- CookieYes Plan: basic (paid)
- Banner Buttons: accept + save preference


## Note
if you have a reject button, you will need to add a query selector for that.
